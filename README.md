<summary><h3>Step 3. Create a new branch for your changes</h3></summary>

When you are in the repository directory run the command (except replace *mr-baldus* with your name)

```bash
git checkout -b adds-mr-baldus
```

It is important to **ALWAYS** do your local work in a branch that is named after what it is doing.

<summary><h3>Step 4. Add your information to the directory.md file</h3></summary>

The easiest way to edit the directory.md file is to just open it with Visual Studio Code. Type 

```bash
code directory.md
```

Then you need to add a section for yourself. Make sure there is a blank line before your section. Each section should look like this:

```markdown
## Mr. Baldus
* email: jason.baldus@gmail.com
* github: jbaldus
* ssh-key: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIO5DTtzsrVzumPE4vjE3SXgGJ3FyoolVMRSh3Fqo3l2z jason.baldus@gmail.com
---
```

Then save the file with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.

Hint: This command will copy your ssh key to your keyboard so you can paste it in here: `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

<summary><h3>Step 5. Commit your changes to your local repository</h3></summary>

Run the git command below to commit your changes to your local repository, but change the *Mr. Baldus* to your name

```bash
git commit -am "Adds Mr. Baldus to directory.md"
```
</details>

<details id=6>
<summary><h3>Step 6. Push your changes up to your Github account</h3></summary>

Run the git command below to push your changes to a branch on Github that matches the branch you made on your local machine. Change the *mr-baldus* part to be your name.

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin adds-mr-baldus
```

Now, if you go back to your Github repository, you will see a notification that your branch had a recent push.

<summary><h3>Step 7. Create a Pull Request on Github</h3></summary>

To request that your changes be incorporated back into the original project, we create a *Pull Request*, which tells the owner of the original project that you have some changes you think would help out. We already have a notification inviting us to create a pull request, so go ahead and click on the green **Compare & pull request** button.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Newaygo-County-CTC-IT/class-directory/main/images/7-create-pr-1.png)

This opens up a page that allows you to explain your changes. For this *PR*, just explain that your change *Adds Mr. Baldus to the directory*, or something similar. Then click the green **Create Pull Request** button

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Newaygo-County-CTC-IT/class-directory/main/images/7-create-pr-2.png)

This will notify Mr. Baldus that you have made a change that you would like to see added to the project, and give him the ability to *merge* your change into the project. He might need to ask you to make some changes first, and that is what the discussion about the *PR* is for.
